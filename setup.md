### Required Software

To complete the activities in the workshop you will need access to some software on your machine. All of these are available for free via the internet, and it should be as easy as downloading the relevant version and double clicking the download to launch the installation process. It should be fairly quick. 

1)	A terminal. Mac users will already have one available via Applications â€“ so no need to do anything. Windows users will need to install/download one. We recommend MobaXterm. An alternative is PuTTY.   

2)	A file transfer client. If you download MobaXterm for (1) then a file transfer client is included in this software. If you are on a Mac or prefer to use an alternative terminal on windows we recommend FileZilla.  Alternatives include Cyberduck or Winscp (for windows).

3)	A text editor. You likely have a basic text editor already installed (e.g. Notepad or WordPad) and there is a text editor inbuilt into MobaXterm but you may prefer to use one that has some enhanced features for writing code, such as syntax highlighting. We recommend Notepad++ or VSCode.

### Need help?

We ask you to try to install these before the start of the first workshop. If you run into problems, please get in touch or make this known at the start of the first session. Having all the software set up ready to go, means we can have a more efficient start. 

If you encounter any difficulties with installation please contact Eilis Hannon. E.J.Hannon@exeter.ac.uk. Alternatively please ask one of the helpers in the first session, prior to the start.
