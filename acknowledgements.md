This workshop was developed by Matthew West and Eilis Hannon. The materials were adapted from [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). Specifically we have developed the [HPC Carpentry Intro to HPC Shell lessons(https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-shell) adding our own custom content to reflect the HPC systems at Exeter.
