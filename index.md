## Overview

A high performance computing (HPC) cluster is an essential tool for computational tasks that are too intensive for a personal computer, for example analysing large datasets. This course will introduce ISCA, the Exeter’s HPC cluster, and teach participants how to design a HPC workflow, interrogate the Slurm scheduling system, and run simple applications on cluster. At the end of this interactive course, participants will be able to translate what they have learnt to improve the efficiency of their computational research. 
This course is aimed at those who plan to use ISCA to perform their computational research or who wish to learn what ISCA could enable them to do.


## Course objectives

This course will covering the following:

- what an high performance computing (HPC) cluster is and what type of tasks it is suited to.
- what computing resources are necessary to run a large workload.
- how to log on to the cluster and navigate around the file system
- how to submit and manage job tasks in the scheduler’s queue.
- the array jobs syntax, a tool to efficiently parallel repetitive tasks.


## Pre-requisite knowledge

- An account on ISCA
- Some experience with the command line (e.g. attended an Introduction to Unix Course).

## Feedback

Please remember to complete a feedback survey. Our workshops are under continual review and your experiences, suggestions and criticism are invaluable for shaping the direction of this initiative. This is especially important if you complete the materials in your own time as it enables us to measure impact. If you have ideas on other courses you would like to see then please contact Eilis Hannon: <E.J.hannon@exeter.ac.uk>.

## Acknowledgements

These materials were adapted from [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). Specifically we have developed the [HPC Carpentry Intro to HPC Shell lessons(https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-shell) adding our own custom content to reflect the HPC systems at Exeter. The materials were developed by a team of researchers at the University who are enthusiastic about sharing their skills with the wider research community. Its provision is dependent on the time of these individuals. If you have benefitted in any way from this course and want to support its long term sustainability then please take the time to complete our feedback survey, recommend it to your colleagues, and enthuse about it to your senior leadership team.
