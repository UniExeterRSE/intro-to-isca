## Welcome

Welcome to **Introduction to HPC and ISCA**. 

We will start by introducing the workshop leaders and helpers. We are all here because we are passionate about sharing our knowledge and supporting the development of our colleagues. For most of us, this is not a requirement of our current position and we are doing this at the margins of our time. 

We ask you to mark your attendance so we are able to report at the end of academic year how many staff & students we have delivered to.


## Introduction to Coding For Reproducible Research

Our ambition is to offer a recurring annual series of workshops open to all staff and students, with opportunities for novices through to more experienced users, to expand their skillsets and position them to confidently perform the informatics research projects in an efficient and reproducible way. A key objective is that the framework we put in place ensures that the workshops delivered are fit for purpose, of a consistent high standard, that delivery is sustainable in the longer term, minimises the workload burden on those who facilitate them and can adapt and expand as new training needs are identified.

Championed by and in partnership with

- Research Software Engineering group
- Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (IDSAI)
- Researcher Development (Doctoral College and ECRs)
- Reproducibility Network Institutional Leadership team
- Quantitative Health Network (QHN) 
- EPSRC Hub for Quantitative Modelling in Healthcare
- Translational Research Exchange @ Exeter (TREE)

This workshop, and the others in the series, was put together by Research IT, the Research Software Engineering Group alongside other researchers at UoE. It has been adapted from the (HPC Carpentries lessons)[https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/hpc-shell/]. The programme and workshops are under constant evolution. We appreciate your patience as we develop and test these materials and we are grateful for your (feedback)[https://forms.office.com/r/s4GK3VjT6v] which is a core component of this process. 



## Housekeeping

The workshop in organised into episodes of content, which can be seen in the workshop schedule available on the course website. Our aim is to have an official break every 60-90 minutes, but there will also be periods between demonstrations where you are free to take additional comfort breaks if required.  This workshop will be delivered using live coding which you should follow along too. There will also be exercises to consolidate our knowledge. 
  

This course will consistent of taught content and activities, some of which you will be lead through. Our aim is to be responsive to the needs of the group, both in person and virtual. Therefore, think of the schedule as a guide rather than a strict timetable. We welcome questions and queries as we go along, there are helpers in the room so raise your hand if you need assistance. There is also a dedicated helper for the virtual participants so please raise your virtual hand to attract their attention.
